# Redash Back-end Handler
## Welcome to the project!

### What you'll find here:

- Tools to work with YouTube metadata
- A way to create cool charts and visuals from youtube-metadata to (Redash)
- A way to ask questions and get answers about the data (OpenAI) "PART OF LLM"

## Getting started:

1. **Install the needed tools:**
   - Check out the list in `requirements.txt`.
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal to install them all at once.

2. **Set up Redash:**
   - Type `docker-compose up -d` in your terminal. This gets Redash up and running.
   - Grab the API keys from your Redash dashboard and save them in a file called `.env`.

3. **Prepare the data:**
   - The `util` folder has a tool to get your YouTube metadata ready.
   - It'll create a table in PostgreSQL (a database) and load everything in there.

4. **Check out the SQL queries:**
   - The `db_schema` folder has the SQL queries that power the Redash dashboards.

5. **Use the API endpoints:**
   - `execute_queries()`: Runs Redash queries based on stuff generated by OpenAI.
   - `generate_response(user_prompt)`: Takes a question from a user, gets it ready, and uses OpenAI to create a response in a file called `openai.json`.

## FINALLY

Now you can explore the data and create awesome visualizations with Redash. And you can ask questions about the data using OpenAI. and call the api using 
- `localhost:5000/execute_queries`
- `localhost:5000/generate_response(user_prompt)`
